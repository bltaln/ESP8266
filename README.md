Simple ESP8266 Terminal


This project implements a web-based terminal for the ESP8266 microcontroller, providing users with the ability to interact with the device through an intuitive and user-friendly interface. 
The terminal allows sending commands and receiving information about the system's status and environment, facilitating device management and monitoring over a WiFi connection.

Features
1. WiFi Network Scanning
Scan WiFi: Allows scanning and displaying available WiFi networks in the vicinity of the device.
2. System Information
SysInfo: Provides details about the configuration and performance of the ESP8266 board, including firmware version, available memory space, CPU frequency, and flash chip information.
3. WiFi Connection Management
WiFi Status: Displays the current status of the WiFi connection, including the network SSID, device IP address, and signal strength.
4. Memory Information
Memory Info: Offers detailed information about memory usage, such as free heap space, heap fragmentation, and maximum free block size.
5. Device Status Monitoring
Uptime: Shows the total uptime of the device since the last boot or reset.
6. GPIO Control (optional)
GPIO Control: Allows users to control GPIO pins of the microcontroller to interact with external devices.

Usage :
Connect to WiFi Network: Ensure that the ESP8266 device is connected to an available WiFi network.
Accessing the Terminal: Open a web browser and enter the IP address of the ESP8266 device in the address bar.
Interacting with the Terminal: Use the available buttons to send commands and receive information about the system's status and environment.
Monitoring and Managing the Device: Utilize the provided information to monitor the device's status and perform management actions, such as rebooting or monitoring the WiFi connection.
Through this web-based terminal, users can quickly and easily access information about the ESP8266 device and perform management actions without requiring a direct physical connection to the device.
